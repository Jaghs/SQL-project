# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
```
The goal for the project is to further my SQL skills mainly in extracting and transforming data with queries and QA processes.
```


## Process
```
1. Loading csv files into PostgreSQL and properly formatting data 
2. Data cleaning the databases and looking for potential issues that could alter results
3. Going through the required problems and using queries to answer the questions to achieve certain results
4. Double checking my data outputs through QA and validation queries
```

## Results
```
The data provided told me alot about the process of the ecommerce business. I used the databases to gain a specialized insight on certain areas of the business such as revenue, top-selling products, average number of visitors, and unique patterns.
```
## Challenges 
```
It was challenging to go through a lot of data in the short amount of time. However, this allowed me to work under pressure and learn newer/faster ways of completeing tasks.

I also found it challenging knowing when to use certain functions over others and how I could be more efficient/cleaner with my queries.
```

## Future Goals
```
Given more time it would be much easier to go through all the data in detail and allow for a deeper understanding of the datasets.

My querires could have also been improved to be more efficient and have less clutter.
